# Sign-Language-Detection

This project develops a basic communication system using hand gestures. By utilizing a webcam and OpenCV for dataset collection and a TensorFlow model for gesture recognition, the system enables real-time interaction through gestures like 'Hello' and 'Thank you'. Future enhancements include multi-user interaction through hand detection.
